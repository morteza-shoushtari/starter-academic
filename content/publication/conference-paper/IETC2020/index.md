abstract: This paper studies combine-then-equalize and equalize-then-combine receiver architectures in a multicarrier scenario motivated by 5G cellular systems. The BER performance of these two receiver architectures with polarization diversity is compared. The results show that the combine-then-equalize approach better exploits the inherent diversity in the system.
