abstract: 16APSK is a candidate modulation for aeronautical telemetry because it has better spectral efficiency than SOQPSK-TG, but requires a linear RF power amplifier. This paper investigates the BER performance of filter-based equalizers for 16APSK operating over multipath channels measured at Edwards AFB. The results show that decision feedback equalizers outperform the other equalizers and are capable of providing excellent multipath mitigation.
